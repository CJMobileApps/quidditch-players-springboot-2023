- [Jetpack Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) - Android Jetpack's Navigation component helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer.
- [Compose UI Test](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/testing) - Compose provides a set of testing APIs to find elements, verify their attributes and perform user actions. They also include advanced features such as time manipulation.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) - Asynchronous or non-blocking programming is an important part of the development landscape. When creating server-side, desktop, or mobile applications, it's important to provide an experience that is not only fluid from the user's perspective, but also scalable when needed.
- [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.

- [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) - JUnit 5 is the next generation of JUnit. The goal is to create an up-to-date foundation for developer-side testing on the JVM. This includes focusing on Java 8 and above, as well as enabling many different styles of testing.
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - A logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class.
